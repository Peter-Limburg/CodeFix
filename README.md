ü§ñ CodeFix AI - Intelligent Bug Analysis System

AI-powered bug analysis using semantic similarity search to understand the meaning of your problems, not just keywords.

üéØ What This Demonstrates
This project showcases practical AI engineering skills by implementing semantic similarity search for bug analysis. Instead of simple keyword matching, it uses sentence transformers to understand the contextual meaning of bug descriptions.
AI Approach vs Traditional:
‚ùå Traditional: "component" + "update" ‚Üí Generic keyword matches
‚úÖ Semantic AI: "My todo list doesn't reflect new items" ‚Üí React state mutation solution

üöÄ Quick Start

1. Install Dependencies
   bashpip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the API
   bashpython main.py

# API will be available at http://localhost:8000

# Interactive docs at http://localhost:8000/docs

3. Test the AI
   bashcurl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/analyze-bug" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
   "title": "My React component won'\''t update when I add items",
   "description": "I have a todo list and when I click add, nothing shows up on screen",
   "tech_stack": "react",
   "code_snippet": "const addTodo = () => { todos.push(newItem); setTodos(todos); }"
   }'
4. Try the Demo Interface
   bashstreamlit run frontend/demo.py

# Opens browser interface for easy testing

üß† AI Implementation
Core Technology:

Sentence Transformers: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model for semantic embeddings
Cosine Similarity: Mathematical relevance scoring between bug descriptions
Confidence Scoring: Multi-factor algorithm considering similarity and context
Pre-computed Embeddings: Optimized for fast response times

How It Works:
python1. User Bug Description ‚Üí Sentence Transformer ‚Üí 384-dimensional Vector 2. Vector Comparison ‚Üí Cosine Similarity ‚Üí Relevance Scores with Known Bugs  
3. Best Match Selection ‚Üí Confidence Calculation ‚Üí Enhanced Solution Response

üéØ Current Capabilities
Supported Bug Types (React Focus):
Currently trained on 3-4 high-confidence React bug patterns:
Bug CategoryExample IssuesAI ConfidenceState ManagementuseState mutations, state not updatingHighEffect HooksuseEffect infinite loops, dependency issuesHighEvent HandlingHandler binding problems, event issuesMediumAsync OperationsPromise handling, async/await errorsMedium
What Makes the AI Smart:

Semantic Understanding: Recognizes "won't update" = "not re-rendering"
Context Awareness: Considers code snippets and error messages
Confidence Scoring: Provides reliability estimates for solutions
Pattern Matching: Identifies common React anti-patterns

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
AI Engine Core:
pythonclass BugSolutionAI:
def **init**(self): # Load pre-trained sentence transformer model
self.model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
self.examples = self.load_examples()
self.example_embeddings = np.load('data/embeddings.npy')

    def find_solution(self, bug_report):
        # Generate embedding for user's bug description
        bug_embedding = self.model.encode([bug_report.description])

        # Calculate cosine similarity with known bug examples
        similarities = cosine_similarity(bug_embedding, self.example_embeddings)

        # Find best match and calculate confidence
        best_match_idx = np.argmax(similarities)
        confidence = self.calculate_confidence(similarities[0][best_match_idx])

        # Return solution if confidence is above threshold
        if confidence > 0.5:
            return self.format_solution(self.examples[best_match_idx], confidence)
        else:
            return None  # No confident match found

Confidence Scoring Algorithm:
pythondef calculate_confidence(self, similarity_score):
"""
Multi-factor confidence calculation
Currently: Based primarily on cosine similarity
Future: Include keyword matches, code pattern analysis
"""
base_confidence = float(similarity_score)

    # Apply sigmoid-like transformation to spread scores
    adjusted_confidence = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-10 * (base_confidence - 0.5)))

    return min(max(adjusted_confidence, 0.0), 1.0)

Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
üö´ Don't try to perfect the AI algorithm
üö´ Don't add more than 4 examples in Week 1
üö´ Don't over-engineer the confidence scoring
üö´ Don't build complex UI in Week 1
‚úÖ DO focus on getting semantic similarity working reliably

üìù Technical Implementation Notes
Model Choice Rationale:
all-MiniLM-L6-v2: 384 dimensions, 80MB, good speed/accuracy balance
Alternative: all-mpnet-base-v2 (768 dims, better accuracy, slower)
Embedding Storage:

# Simple file-based storage for MVP

embeddings = np.load('data/embeddings.npy')

# Later: Move to vector database like ChromaDB

Error Handling Strategy:

# Graceful degradation if AI fails

try:
ai_solution = ai_engine.find_solution(bug_report)
except Exception as e:
logger.error(f"AI failed: {e}")
ai_solution = fallback_keyword_search(bug_report)
